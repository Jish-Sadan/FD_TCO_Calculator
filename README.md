2.  In your repository's settings, navigate to the **Pages** section.
3.  Choose the `main` branch as your source and click **Save**.
4.  Your TCO calculator will be live at the provided URL within a few minutes.

### Local Development

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All pricing and product details are managed in a single JavaScript object at the top of the `script.js` file. To customize the calculator for your own products, simply edit the `pricingData` object.

```javascript
// Located at the top of script.js
const pricingData = {
    "FD_Omni": { // Product ID
        "annual": { "Growth": 29, "Pro": 59, "Enterprise": 109 }, // Annual prices per plan
        "monthly": { "Growth": 35, "Pro": 71, "Enterprise": 131 } // Monthly prices per plan
    },
    // ... more products
    "addOns": {
        "perAgent": {
            "aiCopilot": { /* ... */ } // Per-agent add-ons
        },
        "packs": {
             "aiAgentSessions": { price: 100, size: 1000 } // Pack-based add-ons
        },
        "tiered": {
            "marketingContacts": [ /* ... */ ] // Tiered add-ons
        }
